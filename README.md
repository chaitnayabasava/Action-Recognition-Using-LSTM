# Action-Recognition-Using-LSTM
Code for Action recognition in hazy videos using LSTM's and Bi-directional LSTM's

Place the UCF-101 dataset in /demo/very_large_data folder.

Now run any of the train files inside "demo" folder for training the corresponding model.
These trained models can be for prediction by running the corresponding predict file inside of the "demo" folder.

This project uses a pre-trained aod-net (a single image dehazing model) while extracting features from each frame.
